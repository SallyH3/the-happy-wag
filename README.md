# The Happy Wag

## Abstract:

As a solo project, I created an app for users to explore animals they might be interested in adopting as a companion/'furry kid'. My users wanted a place that is a casual experience where they can look through different animals and primarily focus on the meeting in-person experience of the adoption process. As a personal goal, I wanted to successfully test all aspects of Redux and gain a more thorough understanding of Redux.
